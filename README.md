## 👋 Hi there!

I'm **Hlib Ishchenko**, a Computer Science student, builder of strange ideas, and a certified overthinker™ when it comes to UX, bugs, and creative solutions.

> *“I don’t just build software — I design systems that think, adapt, and sometimes misbehave (for testing purposes).”*

---

### 🧠 Who am I?

A **multi-disciplinary CS student** who thinks like a product strategist, codes like a frontender, debugs like a QA lead, and dreams like a mad scientist. I specialize in **turning abstract ideas into interactive systems**, while accidentally discovering edge cases most devs never meet.

I don’t chase frameworks — I chase **understanding**. I don’t just ship — I **test, break, rebuild, polish, and then question the entire premise** again.

---

### 🔧 Technologies are just the medium

- **Frontend:** `React`, `Vite`, `JS`, `HTML/CSS`, rapid prototyping  
- **Backend:** familiar with `Go`, experienced with `Python`, `MongoDB`, a bit of `SQL`  
- **AI & CV:** custom neural nets in Python, basic computer vision stuff  
- **Tools:** `Git`, `GitHub`, `draw.io`, `Final Cut Pro`, `Photoshop`, `Premiere`, `Word (unfortunately)`  
- **Game Dev / Modding:** created complex Lua + Python addons like [`StormworksConnect`](https://github.com/DilerFeed/Stormworks-Connect)

---

### 🧪 What makes me tick

- **I prototype ideas** obsessively, whether it’s a web tool, data visualizer, or a ridiculous game mechanic  
- **I test products** like I’m preparing them for the International Space Station  
- **I explore** where software meets human behavior — especially UI/UX edge cases  
- **I question** defaults. Always.  
- **I build projects** that are never small and never “just CRUD”
- ... aaand I love breaking things more than coding them sometimes. Sorry not sorry 😅

### 🥽 Noteworthy Experiments & Outputs

- 🔬 Scientific research in progress (fingers crossed 🤞 for competitions)
- 🛠️ 2 software author certificates (1 granted, 1 incoming)  
- 📹 [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@tesseract) — 2k+ subs mostly from 10 nerdy videos about neural nets
- 🌌 Repositories with attention — one has 20+ ⭐ organically  
- 🧩 Developed a plugin to bridge *real hardware inputs into a game world*, fusing Python, Lua, and a bit of madness

---

### 💭 Core Philosophy

> “Programming is not typing code. It’s encoding thought into structured abstraction that survives reality.”

---

### 📌 What I’m looking for

Not a “job”. A **mission**:  
- Help **envision**, **design**, and **validate** products  
- Test assumptions before they become bugs  
- Work with people who love quality, creativity, and user empathy  
- Possibly wear many hats, and occasionally question the shape of the hat itself 🎩

---

### 📎 TL;DR but in bullet points

- CS student, 4th year  
- Strong frontend + solid backend instincts  
- Always testing, thinking, breaking, rebuilding  
- Love weird bugs, hate repetitive UIs  
- Can explain async rendering to a cat  
- Want to help build something **clever**, **useful**, and **non-boring**

> “I don’t always push to main — but when I do, it’s tested, validated, and probably has a hidden easter egg.”

☕ Not a rockstar developer, but might debug one.
